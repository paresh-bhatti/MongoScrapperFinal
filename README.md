# MongoScrapperFinal
All the News That's Fit to Scrape.

Created a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. 

Users can leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments are saved to the database and can be updated as well and are associated with the articles. 

Utilized all 5 of the following NPM packages:
express
express-handlebars
mongoose
cheerio
axios

Deployed to Heroku (mLab) for the MongoDB database).
